Contains smart and naive simulators for the 2019 NCAA March Madness tournament.

## "SmartSim" (Smart simulator)
A team's chances of winning depend on its corresponding seed's winning percentage in the NCAA tournament's history. The simulator allows for more upsets in early rounds while favoring "chalky" winners later on.

## "LazySim" (Naive simulator)
Both teams in any given matchup have an equal chance of winning. Chaos will ensue.
